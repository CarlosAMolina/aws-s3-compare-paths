## How to run the program

### Export s3 data

In this example we will compare multiple buckets of three different AWS accounts.

Update the `s3-uris-to-analyze.txt` file with your data.

In your terminal, generate AWS credentials to allow botocore to connect with your AWS account.

Run:

```bash
python extract.py
```

Now we have the results for the buckets of one account, to work with another account we must execute the following manual steps to save these results:

```bash
mkdir exports-all-aws-accounts
mv exports exports-all-aws-accounts/aws-account-1
```

As you can see, now the `exports` folder does not exists, this is required to generate new results for the other AWS accounts.

Let's create the second AWS account results!

After update the `s3-uris-to-analyze.txt` file with the second account S3 URIs, we authenticate in the terminal to the second AWS account and run:

```bash
python extract.py
```

We save the created files:

```bash
mv exports exports-all-aws-accounts/aws-account-2
```

We repeat the steps for the third account:

1. Update the `s3-uris-to-analyze.txt` file with the account S3 URIs to analyze.
2. Authenticate in the terminal to the second AWS account.
3. Generate the URIs results running: `python extract.py`
4. Save the created files: `mv exports exports-all-aws-accounts/aws-account-3`

### Prepare s3 data

If the bucket names to compare between each account are different, we must set the same name. The file names must be equal too

You don't need to review it manually, if the values are different, the script will raise an exception and you can modify the wrong names.

For example, if I have these:

```bash
exports-all-aws-accounts
|__aws-account-1/
|  |__cars_pro/
|  |  |_path_foo_old_file_1.txt
|  |__bikes_pro/
|  |  |_path_foo_old_file_bar.txt
|__aws-account-2
|  |__cars_release/
|  |  |_ ...
|  |__bikes_release/
|     |_ ...
|__aws-account-3/
   |__cars_dev/
   | |_ ...
   |__bikes_dev/
   | |_ ...
```

I set the following names:

```bash
exports-all-aws-accounts
|__aws-account-1/
|  |__cars/
|  |  |_path_foo_file_1.txt
|  |__bikes/
|  |  |_path_foo_file_bar.txt
|__aws-account-2/
|  |__cars/
|  |  |_ ...
|  |__bikes/
|  |  |_ ...
|__aws-account-3/
   |__cars/
   |  |_ ...
   |__bikes/
   |  |_ ...
```
